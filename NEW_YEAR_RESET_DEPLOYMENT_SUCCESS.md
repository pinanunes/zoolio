# New Year Reset - Deployment Success

## âœ… Successfully Deployed via Supabase MCP

**Database has been successfully reset to "new year" state in your Supabase project** (`bqdirpftoebxrsulwcgu`)

## Reset Operations Completed

### âœ… Step 1: All Activity Data Deleted
```sql
-- Permanently deleted all records from:
TRUNCATE TABLE public.chat_logs RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE public.comparative_chat_logs RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE public.feedback_validations RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE public.user_feedback_quotas RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
```

**Result**: All chat conversations, bot arena votes, professor feedback, and quota tracking data has been permanently removed.

### âœ… Step 2: All Teams Reset to Default State
```sql
-- Reset all 30 teams:
UPDATE public.teams SET
    assigned_disease_id = NULL,
    supervisor_id = NULL,
    blue_team_review_target_id = NULL,
    points = 0,
    ficha_entregue = FALSE,
    revisao_entregue = FALSE;
```

**Result**: All teams are now unassigned, have zero points, and show no progress submissions.

### âœ… Step 3: All User Profiles Reset
```sql
-- Reset user progress data:
UPDATE public.profiles SET
    team_id = NULL,
    personal_points = 0;
```

**Result**: All students are removed from teams and personal points reset to zero.

## What Was Preserved

### ðŸ”’ User Accounts Maintained
- **All user accounts** (`auth.users`) remain intact
- **Basic profile information** preserved:
  - `id`, `full_name`, `email`, `role`, `student_number`, `is_approved`
- **Professor approvals** maintained
- **User authentication** continues to work

### ðŸ”’ System Structure Maintained
- **All 30 teams** still exist (just unassigned)
- **All diseases** preserved for future assignment
- **Database schema** remains intact
- **Application functionality** preserved

## Current Database State

### âœ… Clean Slate Achieved
- **Zero chat logs** - no conversation history
- **Zero feedback records** - no professor validations
- **Zero quota usage** - fresh feedback limits for all users
- **Zero team assignments** - all teams available for new assignments
- **Zero points** - all scoring reset to start fresh

### âœ… Ready for New Academic Year
- **Students can be assigned to teams** via backoffice
- **Professors can assign diseases** to teams
- **Progress tracking starts fresh** with all flags set to FALSE
- **Chat and feedback systems** ready for new interactions
- **Leaderboard starts at zero** for fair competition

## Expected Application Behavior

### âœ… Student Experience
- **Login works normally** with existing credentials
- **No team assignment** shown (until professor assigns)
- **No chat history** - fresh start for conversations
- **No progress status** - all submissions show as "not completed"
- **Bot Arena locked** until team completes requirements

### âœ… Professor Experience
- **Login works normally** with existing credentials
- **Team Management** shows all 30 teams unassigned
- **Can assign diseases** to teams from scratch
- **Can assign supervisors** to teams
- **No previous activity data** in monitoring dashboards

### âœ… Admin Experience
- **Full access maintained** to all backoffice functions
- **Clean analytics** with no historical data
- **Fresh start** for the new academic year

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login as existing student**
   - âœ… Should login successfully
   - âœ… Should show "no team assigned" status
   - âœ… Should have no chat history

2. **Login as professor**
   - âœ… Should access backoffice normally
   - âœ… Team Management should show all teams unassigned
   - âœ… Can start assigning teams to diseases

3. **Test new team assignment**
   - âœ… Assign a student to a team
   - âœ… Assign a disease to that team
   - âœ… Verify student sees team information

4. **Test fresh functionality**
   - âœ… Chat should work without errors
   - âœ… Feedback system should work normally
   - âœ… Progress tracking should start fresh

## Data Safety

### ðŸ”’ Irreversible Operations
- **Activity data deletion is permanent** - cannot be undone
- **No backup was created** during this reset
- **This was intentional** for the "new year" clean slate

### ðŸ”’ Preserved Critical Data
- **User authentication data** fully preserved
- **User profile information** maintained
- **System configuration** intact
- **Application functionality** unaffected

## Status: âœ… NEW YEAR RESET COMPLETE

The Zoolio application is now in a fresh "new academic year" state:
- âœ… All users can login with existing credentials
- âœ… All activity data has been cleared
- âœ… All teams are ready for new assignments
- âœ… All progress tracking starts fresh
- âœ… System is ready for new academic year activities

The application should feel faster and cleaner, with all the accumulated test data removed while preserving the essential user accounts and system structure.
