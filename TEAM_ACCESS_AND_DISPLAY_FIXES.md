# Team Access and Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Students Not Getting Access to Advanced Bots
**Issue**: Even after setting "Ficha entregue" and "Revisão entregue" as done for a team, students still couldn't access Bot Senior or Arena Bot areas.

**Root Cause**: Field name mismatch between database and frontend:
- Database uses: `ficha_entregue` and `revisao_entregue`
- Frontend was looking for: `has_submitted_sheet` and `has_submitted_review`

**Solution**:
1. **Updated AuthContext.jsx**:
   - Added `ficha_entregue` and `revisao_entregue` to the team data query
   - Mapped these fields to `fichaEntregue` and `revisaoEntregue` in the user context

2. **Updated FrontOffice.jsx**:
   - Removed redundant database query for team progress
   - Now uses team status directly from user context
   - Simplified loading logic since data is already available

### Problem 2: Students Couldn't See Their Group Assignment
**Issue**: Students had no way to see which group they were assigned to.

**Solution**:
- **Updated Header.jsx**: Added team name display below the user role for students
- Team name appears in green color for better visibility
- Only shows for students who have been assigned to a team

## Technical Changes

### AuthContext.jsx
```javascript
// Added to team query
ficha_entregue,
revisao_entregue,

// Added to team object
fichaEntregue: teamData.ficha_entregue || false,
revisaoEntregue: teamData.revisao_entregue || false,
```

### FrontOffice.jsx
```javascript
// Simplified team progress logic
const teamProgress = {
  hasSubmittedSheet: user?.team?.fichaEntregue || false,
  hasSubmittedReview: user?.team?.revisaoEntregue || false
};
```

### Header.jsx
```javascript
// Added team name display for students
{user?.role === 'student' && user?.team?.name && (
  <p className="text-xs text-green-400">{user.team.name}</p>
)}
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Access**: Students now get immediate access to advanced bots when their team status is updated
2. **No Page Refresh Required**: Changes are reflected immediately through the user context
3. **Better UX**: Students can see their group assignment in the header
4. **Simplified Code**: Removed redundant database queries and loading states
5. **Consistent Data**: Single source of truth for team status through AuthContext

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Set "Ficha entregue" to true for a team in the backoffice
2. Student should immediately see Bot Senior tab become available
3. Set "Revisão entregue" to true for a team
4. Student should immediately see Arena de Bots tab become available
5. Students should see their team name (e.g., "Grupo 1") in green text below their role in the header

## Notes

- Changes are backward compatible
- No database schema changes required
- Maintains existing security and RLS policies
- Performance improved by reducing redundant queries
