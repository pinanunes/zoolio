# Three-Phase Bot System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a three-phase bot system for the Zoolio application that progressively unlocks different AI assistants based on team progress. This system encourages student engagement and provides different levels of AI assistance throughout their learning journey.

## Phase System Architecture

### Phase 1: Bot Junior (Always Available)
- **Access**: Available to all students from the start
- **Purpose**: Basic AI assistance for initial learning
- **Features**:
  - General veterinary medicine questions
  - Basic guidance and support
  - Feedback collection system
  - Response time tracking

### Phase 2: Bot Senior (Unlocked after Sheet Submission)
- **Access**: Available after team submits their information sheet
- **Purpose**: Advanced AI trained on student-compiled knowledge
- **Features**:
  - Access to knowledge compiled by students
  - Disease status dashboard showing progress of all teams
  - Real-time disease development tracking
  - Enhanced responses based on student contributions

### Phase 3: Arena de Bots (Unlocked after Review Submission)
- **Access**: Available after team submits their review
- **Purpose**: Comparative AI evaluation and voting
- **Features**:
  - Side-by-side comparison of 3 different bots
  - Voting system for best responses
  - Competitive element to encourage engagement
  - Data collection for bot performance analysis

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Bot Configuration System (`src/config/bots.js`)
```javascript
export const BOTS = {
  bot_junior: {
    id: 'bot_junior',
    name: 'Bot Junior',
    description: 'Assistente bÃ¡sico para perguntas gerais',
    endpoint: 'https://webhook-url-junior.com',
    color: '#3B82F6',
    phase: 1
  },
  bot_senior: {
    id: 'bot_senior', 
    name: 'Bot Senior',
    description: 'Assistente avanÃ§ado com conhecimento compilado',
    endpoint: 'https://webhook-url-senior.com',
    color: '#10B981',
    phase: 2
  },
  // Arena bots configuration...
};
```

### 2. Progressive Unlock Logic
- **Database Fields**: Added `has_submitted_sheet` and `has_submitted_review` to teams table
- **Frontend Logic**: Dynamic tab generation based on team progress
- **Access Control**: Server-side validation of bot access permissions

### 3. Individual Bot Components
- **BotJuniorChat.jsx**: Basic chat interface with feedback system
- **BotSeniorChat.jsx**: Advanced chat with disease status dashboard
- **BotArena.jsx**: Comparative interface with voting mechanism

### 4. Enhanced Frontend Experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Locked tabs show requirements clearly
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded bot identification
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes

## Database Schema Updates

### Enhanced Teams Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.teams 
ADD COLUMN has_submitted_sheet BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN has_submitted_review BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### Bot Tracking in Chat Logs
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.chat_logs 
ADD COLUMN bot_id TEXT;
```
