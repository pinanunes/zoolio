# Database Foreign Key Fix - Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Resolved**

The "Gestão de Grupos" page was showing errors like:
- `Could not find a relationship between 'teams' and 'diseases' in the schema cache`
- `Could not find a relationship between 'teams' and 'profiles' in the schema cache`

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

Using the Supabase MCP tools, I discovered that the original `schema.sql` script created the columns but **forgot to define the foreign key constraints** that Supabase needs to understand table relationships.

**Missing Foreign Key:**
- `teams.supervisor_id` → `profiles.id` (This was the main culprit)

**Already Present Foreign Keys:**
- ✅ `teams.assigned_disease_id` → `diseases.id` (This was actually working)
- ✅ `teams.blue_team_review_target_id` → `teams.id`
- ✅ `teams.red_team_1_target_id` → `teams.id`
- ✅ `teams.red_team_2_target_id` → `teams.id`

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

**Migration Applied:** `add_teams_supervisor_foreign_key`

```sql
-- Add the missing foreign key for teams.supervisor_id -> profiles.id
ALTER TABLE public.teams
ADD CONSTRAINT teams_supervisor_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (supervisor_id) REFERENCES public.profiles(id);

-- Add comment to document the relationship
COMMENT ON CONSTRAINT teams_supervisor_id_fkey ON public.teams 
IS 'Foreign key linking teams to their supervisor (professor)';
```

## ✅ **Verification**

**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED**

All foreign keys on the `teams` table are now properly configured:

1. `teams_assigned_disease_id_fkey` → diseases.id
2. `teams_blue_team_review_target_id_fkey` → teams.id  
3. `teams_red_team_1_target_id_fkey` → teams.id
4. `teams_red_team_2_target_id_fkey` → teams.id
5. `teams_supervisor_id_fkey` → profiles.id ← **FIXED**

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Refresh the page:** Go to `http://localhost:5181/backoffice/teams`
2. **Hard refresh:** Use `Ctrl+F5` to clear browser cache
3. **Test functionality:** The page should now load without errors and allow you to:
   - Assign diseases to teams
   - Assign supervisors to teams
   - Configure Blue Teams and Red Teams
   - Track submission status

## 📁 **Files Created**

- `complete_foreign_key_fix.sql` - Backup script with the fix
- `DATABASE_FOREIGN_KEY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## 🎉 **Result**

The "Gestão de Grupos" page should now work perfectly with all team management functionality operational!
