# Team Management Improvements - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **All Requested Features Successfully Implemented**

### ✅ **1. Restored Full Functionality**
- **Blue Team & Red Team relationships** are now fully operational
- **Complete query with all self-referencing relationships:**
  ```javascript
  .select(`
    *,
    diseases:assigned_disease_id (id, name),
    supervisor:supervisor_id (id, full_name),
    blue_team:blue_team_review_target_id (id, team_name),
    red_team_1:red_team_1_target_id (id, team_name),
    red_team_2:red_team_2_target_id (id, team_name)
  `)
  ```

### ✅ **2. Fixed Supervisor Dropdown**
- **Problem:** Only showing `role = 'professor'`, but admin users weren't appearing
- **Solution:** Changed query to include both professors and admins:
  ```javascript
  .in('role', ['professor', 'admin'])
  .eq('is_approved', true)
  ```
- **Result:** Admin users now appear in the supervisor dropdown

### ✅ **3. Disease Exclusivity Logic**
- **Feature:** Diseases can only be assigned to one team at a time
- **Implementation:** `getAvailableDiseases()` function filters out already assigned diseases
- **Exception:** Shows the currently assigned disease for the team being edited
- **Result:** No duplicate disease assignments possible

### ✅ **4. Blue Team Target Exclusivity Logic**
- **Feature:** Each team can only be a Blue Team target for one other team
- **Implementation:** `getAvailableBlueTeamTargets()` function filters out already assigned targets
- **Exception:** Shows the currently assigned target for the team being edited
- **Result:** No duplicate Blue Team assignments possible

### ✅ **5. Improved Button Colors**
- **Before:** Gray buttons for pending tasks, green for completed
- **After:** 
  - 🔴 **Red buttons** (`bg-red-600`) for pending tasks (✗)
  - 🟢 **Green buttons** (`bg-green-600`) for completed tasks (✓)
- **Enhanced UX:** Clear visual distinction between pending and completed states

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Exclusivity Helper Functions:**
```javascript
// Prevents duplicate disease assignments
const getAvailableDiseases = (currentTeam) => {
  const assignedDiseaseIds = teams
    .filter(t => t.id !== currentTeam.id && t.assigned_disease_id)
    .map(t => t.assigned_disease_id);
  
  return diseases.filter(disease => 
    !assignedDiseaseIds.includes(disease.id) || disease.id === currentTeam.assigned_disease_id
  );
};

// Prevents duplicate Blue Team target assignments
const getAvailableBlueTeamTargets = (currentTeam) => {
  const assignedBlueTargetIds = teams
    .filter(t => t.id !== currentTeam.id && t.blue_team_review_target_id)
    .map(t => t.blue_team_review_target_id);
  
  return teams.filter(t => 
    t.id !== currentTeam.id && 
    (!assignedBlueTargetIds.includes(t.id) || t.id === currentTeam.blue_team_review_target_id)
  );
};
```

### **Enhanced Button Styling:**
```javascript
className={`w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center transition-colors ${
  team.has_submitted_sheet 
    ? 'bg-green-600 text-white hover:bg-green-700'  // ✅ Completed
    : 'bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700'      // ❌ Pending
}`}
```
