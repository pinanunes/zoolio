# Student Analytics System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **New Feature Successfully Implemented**

### ✅ **Student Analytics Page with CSV Export**

A comprehensive student analysis system has been created that provides detailed insights into student performance, participation, and feedback metrics.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Database Function (RPC)**
Created a powerful PostgreSQL function `get_student_analytics()` that efficiently aggregates data from multiple tables:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_student_analytics()
RETURNS TABLE (
  student_id UUID,
  full_name TEXT,
  student_number TEXT,
  team_id INT,
  team_name TEXT,
  assigned_disease_name TEXT,
  red_team_1_disease TEXT,
  red_team_2_disease TEXT,
  total_feedbacks BIGINT,
  approved_feedbacks BIGINT,
  total_points INT,
  average_points_per_feedback NUMERIC
)
```

**Key Features:**
- Joins data from `profiles`, `teams`, `diseases`, `chat_logs`, and `feedback_validations`
- Calculates Red Team diseases (teams that will attack this student's team)
- Aggregates feedback statistics and point calculations
- Computes average points per approved feedback
- Optimized for performance with single database call

### **2. React Component**
Created `StudentAnalytics.jsx` with comprehensive features:

**Data Display:**
- 📊 **Statistics Dashboard:** Total students, students with teams, feedback counts, average scores
- 📋 **Detailed Table:** All student information in organized columns
- 🎨 **Color-coded Badges:** Visual indicators for different metrics

**Export Functionality:**
