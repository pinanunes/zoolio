# 🎯 Leaderboard Green Highlight Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

After fixing the authentication issue, the **green highlight** for the student's team in the leaderboard was missing. The student could see the leaderboard but their team wasn't highlighted in green as it was before.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was in the `ProgressLeaderboard.jsx` component:

1. **Complex Join Query**: The component was using a complex join query between `profiles` and `teams` tables
2. **RLS Policy Conflict**: The new RLS policies were preventing the join from working properly
3. **Missing Team Data**: The `userTeam` state wasn't being populated correctly
4. **Broken Highlighting Logic**: Without `userTeam` data, the green highlight logic couldn't identify the student's team

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Simplified Query Structure
**File**: `src/components/ProgressLeaderboard.jsx`

**Before** (Complex join that was failing):
```javascript
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select(`
    team_id,
    teams (
      id,
      team_name,
      points,
      is_sheet_validated
    )
  `)
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();
```

**After** (Two separate, reliable queries):
```javascript
// Get user's team_id first
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('team_id')
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();

// Then get team details separately
const { data: teamData } = await supabase
  .from('teams')
  .select('id, team_name, points, has_submitted_sheet')
  .eq('id', profile.team_id)
  .single();
```

### Fix 2: Added Student Team Access Policy
**Migration**: `ensure_teams_readable`

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Students can view teams" ON public.teams
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'student')
    );
```

This ensures students can read all team data needed for the leaderboard.

## 🎯 Expected Results

**The green highlight should now work correctly:**

✅ **Student can see leaderboard** with all teams  
✅ **Their team is highlighted** with green ring and background  
✅ **"(Sua Equipa)" label** appears next to their team name  
✅ **Team stats** are displayed correctly in the top cards  
✅ **Team ranking** is calculated and shown properly  

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Green Highlight Logic
```javascript
const isUserTeam = userTeam && team.id === userTeam.id;

// Applied to team row:
className={`${isUserTeam ? 'ring-2 ring-green-500' : ''}`}
style={{ 
  backgroundColor: isUserTeam ? '#065f46' : '#334155'
}}

// Label added:
{isUserTeam && <span className="ml-2 text-green-400">(Sua Equipa)</span>}
```

### Data Flow
1. **Load leaderboard**: Get all teams ordered by points
2. **Get user's team_id**: Simple query to profiles table
3. **Get team details**: Separate query to teams table
4. **Set userTeam state**: Enables highlighting logic
5. **Calculate rank**: Find position in leaderboard array
6. **Apply highlighting**: Green ring and background for user's team

## 🧪 Testing

**To verify the fix works:**

1. **Log in as a student** (e.g., "Estudante teste2")
2. **Navigate to "Progresso" tab**
3. **Check leaderboard section** at the bottom
4. **Verify your team** has:
   - Green ring around the row
   - Green background color
   - "(Sua Equipa)" label
   - Correct team name and points

## 📊 What Was Fixed

### Before Fix:
```
❌ No green highlight on student's team
❌ Complex join query failing with RLS
❌ userTeam state not populated
❌ Missing team identification
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Green highlight restored for student's team
✅ Simplified, reliable query structure
✅ userTeam state properly populated
✅ Clear team identification with label
✅ All team stats displayed correctly
```

This fix restores the visual feedback that helps students quickly identify their team's position in the leaderboard.
