# AuthContext Loading Issue - Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Identified
The application was stuck on the loading screen ("A carregar...") due to a complex SQL query in the `fetchUserProfile` function that was failing silently.

## Root Cause
The original query attempted to join `profiles`, `teams`, and `diseases` tables in a single complex query:
```sql
SELECT *, teams(id, team_name, ..., diseases(id, name))
FROM profiles
WHERE id = user_id
```

This query could fail if:
- User doesn't have a team assigned (team_id is null)
- Foreign key relationships are broken
- Teams or diseases tables have missing data
- Database permissions issues

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Separated Database Queries**
- **Step 1**: Fetch basic profile data first
- **Step 2**: If user has a team, fetch team data separately
- **Step 3**: Handle each query failure independently

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added try-catch blocks around each database operation
- Provided fallback data for each failure scenario
- Added extensive console logging for debugging

### 3. **Safe Defaults**
- Always return a valid user object structure
- Default quota values if database columns are missing
- Graceful degradation when team data is unavailable

## Code Changes Made

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
const { data: profile, error: profileError } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select(`
    *,
    teams (
      id,
      team_name,
      assigned_disease_id,
      supervisor_id,
      blue_team_review_target_id,
      points,
      diseases (
        id,
        name
      )
    )
  `)
  .eq('id', authUser.id)
  .single();
```

### After (Robust):
```javascript
// Step 1: Get basic profile
const { data: profile, error: profileError } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', authUser.id)
  .single();

// Step 2: Get team data separately if needed
if (profile.team_id) {
  const { data: teamData, error: teamError } = await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .select(`
      id,
      team_name,
      assigned_disease_id,
      supervisor_id,
      blue_team_review_target_id,
      points,
      diseases (id, name)
    `)
    .eq('id', profile.team_id)
    .single();
}
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### ✅ **Reliability**
- App will load even if parts of the database query fail
- No more infinite loading screens
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted data

### ✅ **Debugging**
- Console logs show exactly what's happening during authentication
- Easy to identify specific database issues
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Fast loading with basic profile data
- Team data loads separately without blocking the app
- Consistent user object structure across all scenarios

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Easier to debug individual query failures
- Modular approach allows for easier updates
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing Instructions

1. **Refresh the browser** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) → Console tab
3. **Look for log messages**:
   - "Fetching profile for user: [user_id]"
   - "Profile fetched successfully: [profile_data]"
   - "Fetching team data for team_id: [team_id]" (if applicable)
   - "Final user profile: [complete_profile]"

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ **Successful Load**
- App loads to login page or main interface
- No infinite loading screen
- Console shows successful profile fetch logs

### ✅ **Partial Data Scenarios**
- If team data fails: App loads with user profile but team = null
- If quotas missing: App loads with default quota values (5, 5, 5)
- If profile incomplete: App loads with fallback user data

## Fallback Data Structure

When database queries fail, the system provides safe defaults:

```javascript
{
  id: authUser.id,
  email: authUser.email,
  name: "Utilizador", // or extracted from email
  role: "student",
  personalPoints: 0,
  feedbackQuotas: {
    junior: 5,
    senior: 5,
    arena: 5
  },
  team: null
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** - Refresh and verify it loads properly
2. **Check console logs** - Ensure profile fetching works correctly
3. **Test with different user types** - Students with/without teams, professors
4. **Monitor for any remaining issues** - The logs will help identify any edge cases

The application should now load reliably regardless of database state or user configuration.
